GitHub, Inc.

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[3]
GitHub offers both plans for private repositories, and free accounts[4] which are commonly used to host open-source software projects.[5] As of April 2016, GitHub reports having more than 14 million users and more than 35 million repositories,[6] making it the largest host of source code in the world.[7]
The trademark mascot of GitHub is Octocat, an anthropomorphized cat with cephalopod limbs, portrayed in a manga style.[8]
